look at this repo

---

when a level is completed, I don't wanna have to click a button. instead, show an animated "level completed" and automatically move to the next level after a few seconds

---

open it in a browser

---

commit this

---

push it

---

can I run console commands here? Or should I open a separate terminal?

---

back to the game. The maze should get bigger with every level.

---

yes it should get much bigger over time, potentially require horizontal and vertical scrolling

---

the maze doesn't scroll. I just exited at the bottom in level 4. Actually, can we just constantly scroll smootly, so that the avatar is basically always in the middle of the screen?

---

add a keyboard shortcut: hitting n just takes me to the next level

---

ok commit this

---

not yet. I'd like the avatar to move smoothly. Instead of jumping one tile per keystroke, I basically want it to move it like just a few pixels or so
