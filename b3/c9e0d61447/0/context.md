## User Prompts

### Prompt 1

look at this repo

### Prompt 2

when a level is completed, I don't wanna have to click a button. instead, show an animated "level completed" and automatically move to the next level after a few seconds

### Prompt 3

open it in a browser

### Prompt 4

commit this

### Prompt 5

push it

### Prompt 6

can I run console commands here? Or should I open a separate terminal?

### Prompt 7

back to the game. The maze should get bigger with every level.

### Prompt 8

yes it should get much bigger over time, potentially require horizontal and vertical scrolling

### Prompt 9

the maze doesn't scroll. I just exited at the bottom in level 4. Actually, can we just constantly scroll smootly, so that the avatar is basically always in the middle of the screen?

### Prompt 10

add a keyboard shortcut: hitting n just takes me to the next level

### Prompt 11

ok commit this

### Prompt 12

not yet. I'd like the avatar to move smoothly. Instead of jumping one tile per keystroke, I basically want it to move it like just a few pixels or so

### Prompt 13

commit this
